Introduction
The primary goal of this project is to predict house prices based on various features of the houses. We preprocess the data, handle missing values, perform one-hot encoding for categorical variables, and train a machine learning model to make predictions.

#Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Ames Housing dataset. It contains 82 columns describing various attributes of the houses and a target variable SalePrice which represents the price of the house.

#Libraries and Tools
The following libraries and tools are used in this project:
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook (optional for interactive development)

#Model Training and Evaluation
The main steps involved in training and evaluating the model are:
Load the dataset and perform initial inspection.
Handle missing values:
Fill numeric columns with the median.
Fill categorical columns with the most frequent value (mode).
Perform one-hot encoding for categorical features.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train a Random Forest Regressor on the training data.
Evaluate the model using various metrics:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-squared
Visualize the actual vs. predicted prices.

#Results
The Random Forest Regressor model provides a good prediction of house prices. The evaluation metrics and scatter plot of actual vs. predicted prices demonstrate the model's performance.
