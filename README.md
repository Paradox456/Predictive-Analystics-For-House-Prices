# Predictive Analysis for House Prices

This project builds a predictive model for house prices using the Ames Housing dataset. The model is trained using various machine learning algorithms, and includes data preprocessing steps like handling missing values and one-hot encoding for categorical features. Evaluation metrics include MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R-squared, with visualizations of actual vs. predicted prices.

## Introduction

The primary goal of this project is to predict house prices based on various features of the houses. We preprocess the data, handle missing values, perform one-hot encoding for categorical variables, and train a machine learning model to make predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Ames Housing dataset. It contains 82 columns describing various attributes of the houses and a target variable `SalePrice` which represents the price of the house.

## Libraries and Tools

The following libraries and tools are used in this project:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for interactive development)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Predictive-Analysis-For-House-Prices.git
    cd Predictive-Analysis-For-House-Prices
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the dataset `AmesHousing.csv` in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the main script to train and evaluate the model:

    ```bash
    python src/main.py
    ```

## Model Training and Evaluation

The main steps involved in training and evaluating the model are:

1. Load the dataset and perform initial inspection.
2. Handle missing values:
   - Fill numeric columns with the median.
   - Fill categorical columns with the most frequent value (mode).
3. Perform one-hot encoding for categorical features.
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
5. Train a Random Forest Regressor on the training data.
6. Evaluate the model using various metrics:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   - R-squared
7. Visualize the actual vs. predicted prices.

## Results

The Random Forest Regressor model provides a good prediction of house prices. The evaluation metrics and scatter plot of actual vs. predicted prices demonstrate the model's performance.
